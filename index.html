    <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
    <p>Phishing is a type of scam that tricks the victim into giving the scammer their personal and/or sensitive information, generally by social engineering techniques or fraudulent impersonation of an organization or individual. Phishing attempts often try to: steal school account credentials to obtain student information or data, gain control over devices to steal data stored on the device, trick the user into downloading malicious software (such as ransomware), steal personal information to steal their identity, and/or most commonly, steal credit card information. Phishing is not limited to messages either, many shady websites are phishing websites designed to track and gather your information while you unknowingly use their site. These websites may ask for personal information, and may also have malicious code to secretly track your information.
